# About Me

My name is Louis DeLosSantos and I'm currently a software engineer at Isovalent focusing on Cilium,
eBPF and Linux kernel networking.

My interests stretch across infrastructure, systems programming, networking, distributed systems and application architectures.

I've worked at a lot of places, built a lot of things, and enjoy sharing my experience along the way.

# Open Source

I'm an OSS enthusiast. 
Most of my career has been developing and contributing code in an open and shareable environment. 
Below are some of my open source projects.

## [ClairCore](https://github.com/quay/claircore)
I'm the initial designer and creator of the ClairCore libraries.

These libraries, written in Go, provide facilities for the static analysis of container security vulnerabilities. 

## [ClairV4](https://github.com/quay/clair)
I'm the initial designer of the latest edition of Clair.

You can see some of my talks about Clair here:

- [Inside the Indexer](https://youtu.be/pEAU6E1rZWo)

## [litee.nvim](https://github.com/ldelossa/litee.nvim)

Litee.nvim is a framework, written in Lua, for building plugins. 

There are several plugins reachable from the above link's readme. 

Most plugins deal with porting over feature present in VSCode that Neovim lacks.

## [sway-fzfify](https://github.com/ldelossa/sway-fzfify)

A set of scripts I use daily in coordination with the Sway window manager.

Uses FZF to accomplish most Sway navigation needs such as creating and moving
workspaces, selecting marks, launching Linux desktop apps, etc.

## [vimdark](https://github.com/ldelossa/vimdark)

A minimal vim theme based on Chrome's dark reader.

Offers a light theme similar to PaperColor as well.
