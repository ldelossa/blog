# About

My name is Louis DeLosSantos and I'm currently a software engineer at Isovalent focusing on Cilium,
eBPF and linux kernel networking.

My interests stretch across infrastructure, systems programming, networking, distributed systems and application architectures.

I've worked at a lot of places, built a lot of things, and enjoy sharing my experience along the way.

# Open Source

I'm an open source software enthusiast and spend a lot of my time contributing to projects in this space.

## [ClairCore](https://github.com/quay/claircore)
I'm the initial designer and creator of the ClairCore libraries.

These libraries, written in go, provide facilities for the static analysis of container security vulnerabilities. 

## [ClairV4](https://github.com/quay/clair)
I'm the initial designer of the latest edition of Clair.

You can see some of my talks about Clair here:

## [calltree.nvim](https://github.com/ldelossa/)

A neovim plugin which brings over some features from VSCode that were missing.

The main focus is implementing a call-hierarchy GUI which Neovim does not include by default.
