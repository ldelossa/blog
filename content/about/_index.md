# About

My name is Louis DeLosSantos and I'm currently a software engineer at Isovalent.

My interests stretch across infrastructure, systems programming, networking, distributed systems and application architectures.

I've worked at a lot of places, built a lot of things, and enjoy sharing my experience along the way.
